The SWORD Project is an effort to create an ever expanding
software package for research and study of God and His Word.
The SWORD Bible Framework allows easy manipulation of Bible
texts, commentaries, lexicons, dictionaries, etc. Many
frontends are build using this framework. An installed module
set may be shared between any frontend using the framework.

Requires icu4c, also available from builds.slamd64.com
