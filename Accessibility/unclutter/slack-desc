# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

unclutter: unclutter (x11 tool for removing mouse clutter from the screen)
unclutter: 
unclutter: unclutter is a program which runs permanently in the background of
unclutter: an X11 session.  It checks the X11 pointer (cursor) position every
unclutter: few seconds, and when it finds it has not moved (and no buttons are
unclutter: pressed on the mouse, and the cursor is not in the root window) it
unclutter: creates a small sub-window as a child of the window the cursor is
unclutter: in.  The new window installs a cursor of size 1x1 but a mask of all
unclutter: 0, i.e. an invisible cursor.  This allows you to see all the text 
unclutter: in an xterm or xedit, for example.
