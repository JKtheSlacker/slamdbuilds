Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, 
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. 
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that 
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also makes 
a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie, 
like frontend options, or restart X often.

NOTE:  Edit the config before running.  If using the init script in /etc/rc.d,
you should consider changing some variables.  Common practice seems to use:

/var/{lib,log,run}/mpd

for the playlists, logging, and PID (respectively), but the choice is ours.  
Change the user appropriately, and then issue something along the lines of:

chown -R <your_user>:users /var/{lib,log,run}/mpd

to allow the daemon to run as user.
