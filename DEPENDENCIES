I'll be nice and map out dependencies for you here.  It's
still recommended to read the README for each package -
I do make mistakes from time to time, and this is mostly
for my own benefit.  Format is a tree view, starting with
the base package and mapping dependencies below that.
If I don't list a package here, that's because it's happy
by itself.
