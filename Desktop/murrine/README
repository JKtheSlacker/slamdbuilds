GTK2 engine that will make your desktop look like a 'murrina'.

Murrine is an Italian word meaning the glass artworks done by 
Venicians glass blowers. Murrine Engine is a Gtk2 engine that 
will make your desktop look like a beautiful Murrina 
(which is the italian singular of Murrine).

This script is written to install the "default" Murrine themepack for
the murrine engine, and it will print an error (but allow you to continue) 
if you don't have the theme tarball in the build directory. You can obtain 
the Murrine themepack here:
