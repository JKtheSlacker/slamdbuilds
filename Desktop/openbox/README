Openbox is a standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible
window manager.  Openbox was written first to comply with standards
and to work properly.  Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone
working environment, or can be used as a drop-in replacement for
the default window manager in the GNOME or KDE desktop environments.

NOTE: This SlackBuild nows has xinit scripts for openbox and 
openbox-session.  You *must* select "openbox-session" in order to 
use your autostart file.  It is recommended that you run xwmconfig 
to correct this if you have used previous versions of this 
SlackBuild.  Similarly, select "Openbox-Session" instead of 
"Openbox" in KDM/XDM if you want session management and your 
autostart file to be used.

If you do not plan on using a session manager with Openbox you can 
build a smaller binary by disabling session management support.  To 
do this simply configure with '--disable-session-management'.
