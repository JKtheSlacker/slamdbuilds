Openbox is a standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible
window manager.  Openbox was written first to comply with standards
and to work properly.  Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone
working environment, or can be used as a drop-in replacement for
the default window manager in the GNOME or KDE desktop environments.

To use Openbox in KDE or GNOME please specify this in the script or 
when running the script by setting KXINIT or GXINIT to "YES", 
respectively.  For example, to add an option to use Openbox in KDE 
you can run:

KXINIT=YES ./openbox.SlackBuild

If you do not make the package with this support and you want to run 
Openbox in KDE or GNOME, then you should copy the respective xinitrc 
script from /usr/doc/openbox/xinit to /etc/X11/xinit/.  You will 
also need to copy openbox-kde-session or openbox-gnome-session to 
/usr/bin/.  To be used, all the scripts will need to be executable.

NOTE: This SlackBuild nows has xinit scripts for openbox and 
openbox-session.  You *must* select "openbox-session" in order to 
use your autostart file.  It is recommended that you run xwmconfig 
to correct this if you have used previous versions of this 
SlackBuild.  Similarly, select "Openbox-Session" instead of 
"Openbox" in KDM/XDM if you want session management and your 
autostart file to be used.

If you do not plan on using a session manager with Openbox you can 
build a smaller binary by disabling session management support.  To 
do this simply configure with '--disable-session-management'.
