The stalonetray is a STAnd-aLONE systerm TRAY (notification area).
It has minimal build and run-time dependencies: the Xlib only.
Stalonetray runs under virtually any window manager.

To start using stalonetray, you can copy the sample config located in 
/usr/doc/stalonetrayrc-0.7.6/ to ~/.stalonetrayrc - it is well-commented 
and should suffice for a quick start.
