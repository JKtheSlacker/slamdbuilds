MusicPD Client plugin for Xfce panel

This is a simple Musicpd (http://www.musicpd.org) client 
plugin for the Xfce 4.4 panel.
Features include:
- next/stop/play/pause/previous buttons
- current status/playing track when mouse passes over the plugin
- decrease/increase volume with mousewheel
- toggle random/repeat in right-click menu

You will, of course, need mpd installed in order to do anything with this.
