Jam - Make(1) Redux

Jam is a program construction tool, like make(1). Jam recursively builds
target files from source files, using dependency information and updating
actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written in jam's own
interpreted language. The default Jambase is compiled into jam and
provides a boilerplate for common use, relying on a user-provide file
"Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and sources.
