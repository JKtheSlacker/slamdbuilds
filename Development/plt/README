PLT Scheme is an innovative programming language that 
builds on a rich academic and practical tradition.

It is suitable for implementation tasks ranging from 
scripting to application development, including GUIs, 
web services, etc.

It includes the DrScheme programming environment, a 
virtual machine with a just-in-time compiler, tools for 
creating stand-alone executables, the PLT Scheme web 
server, extensive libraries, documentation for both 
beginners and experts, and more.

It supports the creation of new programming languages 
through a rich, expressive syntax system. Example languages
include Typed Scheme, ACL2, FrTime, Lazy Scheme, and 
ProfessorJ (which is a pedagogical dialect of Java).
