FreedroidRPG is a mature open source sci-fi isometric role 
playing game. It strives at providing an immersive ambience
backed by refined graphics and music tracks. Besides the 
hack'n'slash action phases, dialogs with dozens of NPCs 
take care of storytelling. The player can fight with melee 
or ranged weapons, take control of his enemies by hacking, 
and remotely execute code on enemy robots.
