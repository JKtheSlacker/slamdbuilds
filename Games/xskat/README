XSkat lets you play the card game Skat as defined
by the official Skat Order on any Un*x machine running X11. 
Features:
- Single- and multiplayer mode. 
- Playing over LAN or IRC. 
- Game lists and logs. 
- Three types of scoring. 
- English or German text. 
- German or French suited cards. 
- Selectable computer playing strength.

I don't know any IRC channels where people gather to play skat
online, but if you know any, or if you want to start one, you
may email me (I'm not a good card player and a bad loser, I warn you)
