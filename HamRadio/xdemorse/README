xdemorse is a GTK+ graphical version of demorse, using the 
same decoding engine. It has an FFT-derived "waterfall" 
display of the incoming audio signal's spectrum, as well 
as a 'scope-like display of the audio detector's output 
and status of the mark/space discriminator ("slicer"). 
xdemorse also has CAT for the FT-847 and this can be used
to net the receiver's frequency to the incoming signal, 
by clicking near its trace in the waterfall display.
