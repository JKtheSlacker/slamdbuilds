This package provides a software library for manipulating ID3v1 and
ID3v2 tags. It provides a convenient interface for software
developers to include standards-compliant ID3v1/2 tagging
capabilities in their applications.
Features include identification of valid tags, automatic size
conversions, (re)synchronisation of tag frames, seamless tag
(de)compression, and optional padding facilities.

This has been patched with the latest UTF16bugfix patch so that
it correctly writes UTF8 and 16 files.

This SlackBuild is heavily based on alienBob's, but with added
patch for correct UTF handling and some other minor changes.
