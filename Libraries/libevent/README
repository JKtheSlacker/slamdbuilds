libevent (an event notification library, used by memcached)
The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback
function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or
after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also
support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts. 

libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change
the event loop.
