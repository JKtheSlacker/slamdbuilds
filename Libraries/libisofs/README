libisofs is a library to create an ISO-9660 filesystem, and 
supports extensions like RockRidge or Joliet. It is also a full 
featured ISO-9660 editor, allowing you to modify an ISO image or 
multisession disc, including file addition/removal, change of 
file names and attributes, etcetera.

This requires libburn.
