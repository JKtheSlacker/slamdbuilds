libpar2 (file corruption detection library for C++)

libpar2 allows for the generation, modification, verification of  PAR v1.0 
and PAR v2.0(PAR2) sets used for recovery when data is lost or corrupted. When
used with collections of files, some missing files can be regenerated. 

The code was initially extracted from the program par2cmdline (also available
at builds.slamd64.com) to allow developers to use it.

libpar2 requires the libsigc++ library which is also available from 
builds.slamd64.com.
