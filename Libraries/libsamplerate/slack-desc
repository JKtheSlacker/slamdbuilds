# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsamplerate: libsamplerate (Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate:
libsamplerate: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate 
libsamplerate: Converter for audio. One example of where such a thing 
libsamplerate: would be useful is converting audio from the CD sample rate  
libsamplerate: of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz sample rate used by DAT players. 
libsamplerate: SRC is capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions. 
libsamplerate: SRC provides a small set of converters to allow quality to
libsamplerate: be traded off against computation cost.
