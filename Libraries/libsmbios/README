The libsmbios project aims towards providing access to as much BIOS
information as possible. It does this by providing a library of
functions that can be used as well as sample binaries.

Please note that documentation is especially sparse in this package.
There are no man pages, and many of the binaries included here are
untested and perhaps dangerous to use on non-supported hardware.
Known supported hardware consists of most Dell computers.
