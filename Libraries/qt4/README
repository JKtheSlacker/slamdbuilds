Qt 4 is a comprehensive, object-oriented development framework that
enables development of high-performance, cross-platform rich-client
and server-side applications.  When you implement a program with Qt,
you can run it on the X Window System (Unix/X11), Apple Mac OS X, and
Microsoft Windows NT/9x/2000/XP by simply compiling the source code
for the platform you want.  Qt is the basis for the KDE desktop
environment, and is also used in numerous commercial applications.

This Qt 4 package is created to enable co-existence with Slackware
native Qt 3 package; developers should only remember to use versions
with "-qt4" suffix (like "qmake-qt4", "assistant-qt4", "designer-qt4",
etc.) of programs that exist under same names in Qt 3 (and developers
using CMake should be fine without any additional action, because
stock CMake is already looking for "qmake-qt4" first).
