aMule is a multiplatform ed2k client, fork of the eMule client, using the
wxWidgets class library. It was originally forked from the xMule project,
which in turn was forked from the lMule project. This is turn was the
first fork of eMule to run nativly on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

wxGTK is required for this to build; at least version 2.4.x of wxGTK is
needed, but version 2.6.x is recommended (available at builds.slamd64.com).
cryptopp is also required.
