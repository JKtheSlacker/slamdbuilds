BitlBee is an IRC instant messaging gateway licensed under the terms of the
GPL.  It communicates with the end user via the IRC protocol whilst interacting
with popular chat networks such as AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, and Jabber. The user's
buddies appear as normal IRC users in a channel, and conversations use the
private message facility of IRC.

After the installation, you need to modify your /etc/inetd.conf so bitlbee will
be started when /etc/rc.d/rc.inetd is called on bootup.  Add the line below to
your /etc/inetd.conf file:
	6667    stream  tcp nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/bitlbee

Restart inetd (/etc/rc.d/rc.inetd restart). All that is left to do now is
connect your irc client to the localhost.

NOTE: The default "bot"/bitlbee daemon is called 'root'. This is not the root
user on your system. You can easily change it. Register and identify yourself
first, and then:
	rename root BitlBot
	(or whatever you want)
