This builds a package of extra plugins for the Claws-Mail email client.
These include:

* acpi_notifier: Mail notification via LEDs on some laptops
* archive: Adds archiving features to Claws Mail.
* att_remover: Removes attachments from emails.
* attachwarner: Warns about messages mentioning attachments that don't have
                attachments.
* cachesaver: Saves the cache to prevent loss of metadata on crashes.
* fetchinfo: Insets headers containing download info into emails.
* gtkhtml2_viewer: Renders HTML emails using the gtkhtml2 widget.
* mailmbox: Handles mbox format mailboxes.
* newmail: Writes email header summary to a log file.
* notification: Provides various ways to notify the user of new and unread mail.
* perl: Allows the use of perl for message filtering.
* rssyl: Allows you to read RSS newsfeeds.
* spam_report: Reports spam to various places.
* synce: Helps keep the address book of a Windows CD device in sync with Claw's
         addressbook
* tnef_parse: Enables reading application/ms-tnef attachments.
* vcalendar: Allows VCalendar message handling like Evolution or Outlook

Other Requirements:
  Claws-Mail (obviously) available from SlackBuilds.org.
  The notification plugin requires libnotify.
  The archive plugin requires libarchive.
  The gtkhtml2_viewer plugin requires gail.
  The SynCE plugin requires libsynce and librapi2.
  All of these are available from SlackBuilds.org except libsynce and librapi2, 
  and those two are at http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/.

Note: By default the package will include every plugin except SynCE; this can be
changed very easily in the script - it uses a list of plugins to be built, and
plugins can be added or removed easily enough.
