Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/pwdfail and bans IP that makes
too many password failures. It updates firewall rules to reject the 
IP address. These rules can be defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read
multiple log files such as sshd, Apache web server, postfix and others.

See README.SLACKWARE for configuration and upgrade help.
