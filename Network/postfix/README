What is Postfix? It is Wietse Venema's mailer that started life as an
alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program.

Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at
the same time, being sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing
users. Thus, the outside has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is
completely different. 

This script builds postfix with support for Dovecot SASL but does not
include any support for Cyrus-SASL. If you need to enable support for
Cyrus see SASL_README in the source code. You can also enable support
for MySQL and Postgres. This script should find support for BerkleyDB
and PCRE automagically, so no special options are required.  Further,
this script builds postfix with TLS support and requires that openssl
be installed. openssl-solibs is not enough. You can find a SlackBuild
script for Dovecot at http://www.slackbuilds.org/ but you do not need
to install it to use this package without SASL.

A couple things to remember about postfix:
    - this script doesn't add the necessary postfix user and postdrop
      group, but exits if they do not exist. Add these before running
      this script. They should have no special permission and postfix
      should NOT be a member of the postdrop group. The script *WILL*
      offer some sane defaults that won't conflict with the canonical
      users and groups, and shouldn't conflict with any other scripts
      downloaded from slackbuilds.org that require their own uids and
      gids
    - many of the utilities in postfix have multiple manpages such as
      postconf(5) and postconf(8).  Use man -k to find them.
    - subscribe to the postfix-users mailing list

CHANGES: Matt Hayes modified this script for Slamd64 to include
support for mysql.  html_directory was also removed from the script
as this sometimes caused issues with upgrades and the versions not
matching properly in main.cf.  Hopefully, these will help, if not
and enough people request it.. we can go back to Alan's version :)
