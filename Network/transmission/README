Transmission is a lightweight open source BitTorrent client,
providing useful functionality without feature bloat. It consists
of a daemon, a GTK+ and a CLI client.

Dependencies: libevent (available at SlackBuilds.org) is required,
  but transmission will use a built-in libevent if you don't have
  it installed already.
