tsocks allows non SOCKS aware applications (e.g telnet, ssh, etc) to use SOCKS
without any modification. It does this by intercepting the calls that
applications make to establish network connections and negotating them through
a SOCKS server as necessary.

tsocks is based on the use of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable or the 
/etc/ld.so.preload file, you'll need permission to use them (normally it's
allowed, but some customized kernels don't allow this procedure)
