Squeak is a modern, open source, full-featured 
implementation of the powerful Smalltalk programming
language and environment. Squeak is highly-portable - 
even its virtual machine is written entirely in 
Smalltalk making it easy to debug, analyze, and change. 
Squeak is the vehicle for a wide range of projects 
from multimedia applications, educational platforms 
to commercial web application development.

To use Squeak, you'll need a vm image.  You can get one
from the below link:
http://ftp.squeak.org/3.10/Squeak3.10.2-7179-basic.zip

Simply unzip it into your home directory.  Alternatively,
you can put it into someplace like /usr/share/squeak and
set SQUEAK_IMAGE in your environment.
