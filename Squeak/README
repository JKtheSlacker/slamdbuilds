Squeak is a modern, open source, full-featured 
implementation of the powerful Smalltalk programming
language and environment. Squeak is highly-portable - 
even its virtual machine is written entirely in 
Smalltalk making it easy to debug, analyze, and change. 
Squeak is the vehicle for a wide range of projects 
from multimedia applications, educational platforms 
to commercial web application development.
