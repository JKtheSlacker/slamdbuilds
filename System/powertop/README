PowerTOP is a Linux tool that finds the software component(s) that make your
laptop use more power than necessary while it is idle.  As of Linux kernel
version 2.6.21, the kernel no longer has a fixed 1000Hz timer tick.  This will
(in theory) give a huge power savings because the CPU stays in low power mode
for longer periods of time during system idle.
