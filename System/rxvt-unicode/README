rxvt-unicode is an enhanced version of the rxvt terminal emulator.  It has
full unicode and Xft support, does font antialiasing and italics, and has
the same transparency capabilities as ATerm.  It can be extended using Perl.

NOTE: changing to --disable-perl will result in a much leaner package.

libAfterImage is an optional dependency that will greatly enhance
rxvt-unicode.
