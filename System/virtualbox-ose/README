VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is a general-purpose full
virtualizer for x86 hardware.

You'll probably want to add the following lines to your rc.local:

	# Start vboxdrv
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv start
	fi

	# Start vboxnet
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxnet ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxnet start
	fi

This will load the support kernel module and will setup the network
configuration for VirtualBox. You should add similar "stop" lines to
your rc.local_shutdown.

By default you have to create a vboxusers group, for example with
	groupadd -g 215 vboxusers
and make your user a member of that group.
Alternatively, you can run the script with VBOXUSERS=no to allow all
users of your system to start virtual machines.

By default VirtualBox will be compiled with hardening enabled. That
means all binaries will be run suid root, which is the default
behaviour of upstream packages. However, you are still able
to disable this by passing HARDENING=no to the script.
When hardening is enabled, VBOXUSERS is automatically set to yes.

If the VirtualBox Additions ISO is available in the same directory
as the build script, it will be included in the package and placed
under /usr/share/virtualbox/. Same goes for the UserManual
They can be downloaded from:
	http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.1.2/VBoxGuestAdditions_2.1.2.iso
	http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.1.2/UserManual.pdf

Since 2.0.0 there is a Qt4 GUI, which at this point of time is still a little
bit buggy and therefore disabled by default. To enable it pass QT4=yes
to the script. The Qt3 GUI is enabled by default, though that might
change with the next version as it is no longer maintained and likely
to be removed sometime soon. To disable it, pass QT3=no to the script.

If you want pulseaudio support, you have to pass PULSE=yes to the
build script. Additionally VirtualBox requires acpica. Also, the
virtualbox-kernel package is required at runtime.
