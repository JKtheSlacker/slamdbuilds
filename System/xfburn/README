xfburn (cd/dvd burning tool for Xfce)

Xfburn is a simple CD/DVD burning tool based on libburnia libraries. 
It can blank CD-RWs, burn and create iso images, as well as burn 
personal compositions of data to either CD or DVD.  
It is currently under heavy development.  

This requires libburn and libisofs.
