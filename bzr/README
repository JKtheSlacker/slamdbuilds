Bazaar (bzr) is a decentralized revision control system, designed 
to be easy for developers and end users alike.  Bazaar is part of the 
GNU project to develop a complete free operating system.

This requires docutils, which is also available from SlackBuilds.org,
but it is only a build dependency - it is not needed for running bzr.
