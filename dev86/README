This is a complete 8086 assembler and loader which can make 32-bit
code for the 386+ processors.  In the past it was used to compile the
16-bit bootsector and setup binaries for the kernel, but modern
(2.4.x or newer) kernels use GNU ld instead.

There's a package bin86 already included in Slackware, which is a
subset of the programs of dev86. Therefore the bin86 programs are
not included in this package.
