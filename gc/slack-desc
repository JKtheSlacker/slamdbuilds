# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gc: gc (Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector)
gc: 
gc: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used
gc: as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It
gc: allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would,
gc: without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The
gc: collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it
gc: can no longer be otherwise accessed.
