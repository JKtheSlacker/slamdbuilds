GNU Go is a free program that plays the game of Go. 
GNU Go has played thousands of games on the NNGS Go server. GNU Go is
now also playing regularly on the Legend Go Server in Taiwan, on the 
WING server in Japan, and many volunteers run GNU Go clients on KGS. 
GNU Go has established itself as the leading non-commercial go program
in the recent tournaments that it has taken part in.
