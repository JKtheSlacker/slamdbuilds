# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

QScintilla: debugging source code.  These include support for syntax styling, 
QScintilla: error indicators, code completion, and call tips.  The selection 
QScintilla: margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to 
QScintilla: indicate breakpoints and the current line.  Styling choices are 
QScintilla: more open than with many editors, allowing the use of 
QScintilla: proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and
