# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

qca: qca (Qt Cryptographic Architecture)
qca:
qca: QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API,
qca: using Qt datatypes and conventions.  QCA separates the API from the
qca: implementation, using plugins known as Providers.  The advantage of
qca: this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
qca: depending on any particular cryptographic library.  This allows one
qca: to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without needing
qca: to recompile the application.
