# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libvisual-plugins: libvisual-plugins (plugins for the libvisual library)
libvisual-plugins:
libvisual-plugins: By itself, libvisual only provides a framework to build upon.  The
libvisual-plugins: plugins in this package are designed to work with libvisual to allow
libvisual-plugins: it to actually do all sorts of interesting visualizations based on
libvisual-plugins: metrics gathered as players process audio information data.  Plugins
libvisual-plugins: can be mixed (more than one run at a time), or morphed from one to
libvisual-plugins: another.  Other special effects are possible as well.
