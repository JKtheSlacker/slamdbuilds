Mednafen is a multi-game-system emulator, for various platforms, 
including emulation of Atari Lynx, Famicom, GameBoy (Color), 
GameBoy Advance, Neo Geo Pocket (Color), NES - both NTSC and PAL, 
PC-FX, WonderSwan (Color), PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 (CD) and SuperGrafx.

Mednafen requires libsndfile, and will use jack-audio-connection-kit 
if it's available at build time; both are available from SlackBuilds.org.
