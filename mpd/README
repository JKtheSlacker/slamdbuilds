Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, 
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. 
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that 
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also makes 
a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie, 
like frontend options, or restart X often.

NOTE:  You will have to create a directory manually, ~/.mpd/playlists.  
Also, be sure to edit the config file (/etc/mpd.conf), if needed, before 
running the daemon.  

If save status isn't working properly when killing, try "killall -TERM mpd", 
and that should resolve the problem.
