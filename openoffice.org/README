OpenOffice.org is a full-featured open-source office suite that is compatible 
with all other major office software.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's) 
distributed by openoffice.org.  Everything needed by the application should 
be built statically into it, so there aren't any dependencies not satisfied 
by a normal installation.  A java runtime environment (jre) is suggested by 
openoffice.org, but it is not required (note that jre is part of a standard
installation of Slackware).

Please don't file bug reports relating to the fact that the resulting package 
doesn't open MS Office files by default.  Default applications to open specific 
file types is a per-user setting, and and installing some application should 
not change it.  See these two links for more info:

Please don't file reports about us not using the the 'slackware-menus' package
included in the desktop-integration/ directory.  We don't use that package for
the following reasons:
  1. The package installs to /opt/openoffice.org2.4, but then a symlink is 
     created in /etc to that same directory (/etc/openoffice.org2.4).
     This is not expected behavior from Slackware packages - we don't typically
     put binary files in /etc, and we certainly don't have entire software 
     packages installed there.
  2. It installs the icons to /opt/kde/share/icons instead of /usr/share/icons.
     This is fine if you're running kde on Slackware 11.0 or earlier, but for
     those people who use gnome or anything on Slackware 12.0 or later, it's 
     a Bad Thing.  The generic freedesktop menu integration package is better
     in that respect, as it puts everything in /usr/share/icons/  
  3. The only other thing the 'slackware-menus' package does is set up the 
     symlinks for the *.desktop files in /usr/share/applications, and it's done
     with them linked from /etc/openoffice.org2.4...  Since we don't want the
     link to /etc at all, this is useless to us.  

Be sure to look at the script for some optional things you can do when building 
(disable the Java loader and add the Optimization Solver).

NOTE: DO NOT use OpenOffice.org's built-in updater to update after installing
      with this script.
