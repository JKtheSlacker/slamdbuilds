RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third party
libraries.

NOTICE:
 while the rubygems installation will be managed with this SlackBuild,
 the gems that will get installed to --local 'system', will be existing 
 in '/usr/lib64/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/' 
 You can 'uninstall' them with `gem`, but otherwise they will remain
 if the rubygems package is removed.


DEPENDENCIES:

* ruby (it comes in a typical slackware installation)
