SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from
basic features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more
advanced features like support for MPlayer filters and more.

There are some optional icon themes available. If you would like
to include them in your package, place these files in the same
directory as smplayer.SlackBuild
