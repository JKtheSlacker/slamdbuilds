This package adds the Subversion bindings for Perl, Python and Ruby.

These are actually part of the Subversion source distribution, but aren't 
availabile in the Slackware package since they require Swig, which is not 
part of Slackware.  The JavaHL bindings are NOT installed by this script.  
You will need this package to use "git svn".

Swig is required to build this package.
