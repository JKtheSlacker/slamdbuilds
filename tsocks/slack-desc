# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tsocks: tsocks (transparent SOCKS proxying library)
tsocks:
tsocks: tsocks allows non SOCKS aware applications (e.g telnet, ssh, etc) 
tsocks: to use SOCKS without any modification. It does this by intercepting
tsocks: the calls that applications make to establish network connections 
tsocks: and negotating them through a SOCKS server as necessary.
