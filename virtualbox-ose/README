VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is a general-purpose full
virtualizer for x86 hardware.

You'll probably want to add the following lines to your rc.local:

	# Start vboxdrv
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv start
	fi

	# Start vboxnet
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxnet ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxnet start
	fi

This will load the support kernel module and will setup the network
configuration for VirtualBox. You should add similar "stop" lines to
your rc.local_shutdown.

By default you have to create a vboxusers group, for example with
	groupadd -g 215 vboxusers
and make your user a member of that group.
Alternatively, you can run the script with VBOXUSERS=no to allow all
users of your system to start virtual machines.

If the VirtualBox Additions ISO is available in the same directory
as the build script, it will be included in the package and placed
under /usr/share/virtualbox/. It can be downloaded from:
	http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/2.0.2/VBoxGuestAdditions_2.0.2.iso

Since 2.0.0 there is a Qt4 GUI, which at this point of time is still a little
bit buggy and therefore disabled by default. To enable it pass QT4=yes
to the script.  The Qt3 GUI is enabled by default, though that might
change with the next version as it is no longer maintained and likely
to be removed anytime soon. To disable it, pass QT3=no to the script.

If you want pulseaudio support, you have to pass PULSE=yes to the
build script. Additionally VirtualBox requires acpica and dev86. The
virtualbox-kernel package is required at runtime. All dependencies
are available from SlackBuilds.org
