Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

If your video card does not support hardware-accelerated OpenGL, then run the
script like this:  OPENGL=NO ./wine.SlackBuild

If you wish to apply an unoffical patch that might fix up some problems
running IE in wine, then do this: IEFIX=YES ./wine.SlackBuild

While it's not strictly required, the fontforge package is strongly 
recommended to be installed when building wine.
