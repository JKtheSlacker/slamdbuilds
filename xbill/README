The xbill game tests your reflexes as you seek out and destroy all
forms of Bill, establish a new operating system throughout the
universe, and boldly go where no geek has gone before.  Xbill has
become an increasingly attractive option as the Linux Age progresses,
and it is very popular at Red Hat.

NOTE:
Per default xbill sets its score file world writable
which obviously allows cheating ones hi-score :-(
Probably this came about since GTK+ doesn't allow setgid?
 
In the install-script we move xbill to xbill-bin and install
a wrapper thingy as xbill instead, with setuid and video group
executable filesystem perms. There we change groups to games.

In the resulting package /var/xbill is group-writable only...
